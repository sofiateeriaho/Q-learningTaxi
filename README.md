## Analysis of Q-learning and Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off in Taxi Problem

A project to model Q-learning in OpenAI’s Gym environment. More specifically using the ’Taxi-v3’ environment to illustrate how we can apply **reinforcement learning** in combination with different exploration-exploitation methods.
